<h3>Traveling</h3>
<p> I have always had a passion for exploring and getting outside, and travelling to new places
allows me to live out that passion! Monuments are definitely neat, however I enjoy travelling more 
so to experience the change in environment and culture rather than to check out the cool tourist spots. </p>

<h3> Trip to Scotland </h3>
<p> Three good friends and I decided to travel to Scotland in 2021 and it was one of my favorite trips! We went to a new city everyday for 5 days and covered Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Inverness, and Isle of Skye! </p>

<h3> Trip to Italy </h3>
<p> My dad is in the Army and was stationed in Northern Italy for a few years, and I got the pleasure of visiting him 
with my three siblings during the Summer of 2021! </p>

<h3> Baking </h3>
<p> If I weren't pursuing a career in Web Development, I would probably be trying
to open my own bakery! <br> I bake just about anything, but my specialty is cookies.
On the left are brown butter chocolate chip cookies and on the right is cookie butter banana bread. <br>
Click on the images for some recipes! </p>

<h3> Hiking Mount Pasubio </h3>
<p> While visiting my dad in Italy, we decided to hike what is called the Strade delle 52, or  "52 Tunnels".
 This was definitely not the leisurely hike we were expecting (silly Americans!) and covered a little over 4 miles
with an elevation change of 2,460ft. Though hard because we were ill-prepared, it was beautiful! </p>
