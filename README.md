# About Me Website

Welcome to my personal website repository! This was one of my first projects and is a personal website created entirely from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes a homepage, a resume page, a page dedicated to my cat, a contact me page, and a personal interest page. The website is designed to showcase my basic skills in web development.

2. **Resume Page:** Contains my resume and a link to a page about my cat.
3. **Cat Page:** A dedicated page about my cat, linked within the resume page.
4. **Contact Me Page:** A form for visitors to contact me (Note: All contact information is fake and this form was linked to a database but the website is no longer online).
5. **Personal Interests Page:** A page that details my hobbies and interests.

## Technologies Used

Please note that this website is a very basic project intended to showcase my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. It is not fully responsive on all devices, and there is no real contact information provided on the contact page.
